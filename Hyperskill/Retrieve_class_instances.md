- The `java.lang.Class` takes a central place in the reflection package. It represents a structure of classes and interfaces by aggregating information on constructors, fields, methods, superclasses, interfaces, and so on.
- In other words, if you have an instance of a class of a specific type, you can obtain all information about the type. That's why java.lang.Class is so important
