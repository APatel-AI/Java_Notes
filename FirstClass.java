// Notes

// The word "public" is a Java keyword which is called an access modifier
// What does an access modifier do: it allows us to define which parts of our code, or even someone else's code, can access a particular element
public class FirstClass { 
    // what is a method: a collection of statements, one or more, that perform an operation.
    // Below we are using the "main" method which is an entry point for any java code which java looks for to start and run the program.
    // static is java keyword and a part of the OOP concept which will be included in the later notes but it is essential in helping java find the method "main" or any other custom method
    // void is a java keyword used to indicated that the method will not return any values after executing.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello World");
    }
}
